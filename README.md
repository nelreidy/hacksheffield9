# Grow a Human Simulator

This is our HackSheffield 9 submission on the theme of growth.

Imagine a simulation where you’re not just raising a character—you’re engineering life. The "Grow a Human" project is an interactive experience that blends science, fun, and strategy to simulate the journey of creating and evolving a human being.

From feeding your character nutritious or not-so-nutritious foods, to managing their health, fitness, and happiness, every decision impacts their growth. But this isn’t just a simple game—it’s a challenge. Can you keep your human alive, healthy, and thriving? Or will experiments with "radioactive cookies" and "cyanide treats" derail their development?

Perfect for teaching decision-making, biology, and systems thinking, this project combines humour with thought-provoking gameplay. Whether you’re aiming to grow a superhuman with glowing skin and super strength or just trying to survive a decade without growing a second green head, "Grow a Human" is an unforgettable experience in digital evolution.

Will your creation thrive—or dive? The choice is in your hands.
